# Action Controller
iOS 8 Project demonstrating how to use a UIActionController

Up until iOS 7 we could use the UIAlertView and UIActionSheet classes to bring up alerts and action sheets respectively. As of iOS 8 those classes are deprecated. Although they still work, we're encouraged to use the UIActionController class instead. This project shows how to use it.

Upon launch you'll find three buttons in a single view application. They do the following:
 # bring up an action controller that looks like an alert view
 # same as above, but with additional text field
 # bring up an action controller that looks like an alert sheet
